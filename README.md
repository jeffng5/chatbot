# chatbot

### This AI chatbot uses the ChatGPT API written in Python and accepts a user recorded conversation usually in the form of a question using the local hardware mic to record. The audio is translated into text with the API and is then inputted into ChatGPT which will produce a response. The text response is again made into an audio file and played back to user. This process may take several seconds to half a minute depending on the length of the ChatGPT response. Please wait for it as it has not malfunctioned. The basic UI and frontend is basic HTML and CSS with a Flask backend. Tests will be done at a later time.
